Website I don't like
-Yahoo, The website feels cluttered and clastrophobic almost, the amount of information and images make it hard to distingush between adds and tone of story.

Website I like
-BBC, Counter to Yahoo, BBC feels easy to read and the way that it presents data to the user is much easier to understand, unlike Yahoo the top bar disapears on scroll down, types ofb stories are signified by backround image with subject name to easily tell the user that they have changed topics. The actual news stories have an image with the headline and a blurb about it with a color cordinated tag at the bottom of the story element that signifies the story category (World news, Sports, Europe) to easily let the user know if it matters to them. I really love the design elements and user experiance.

Website I dislike
-Norrköpings brädspelscafé, Its a boardgame cafe website. It's supposed to have a storefront but won't let you buy anything unless your the website admin but even after being told about this it hasn't changed. Several of the home page elements are not uniform sized with the images and go from small to huge, the div height is auto and scales off of image width which resulted in massive difference image sizes.
