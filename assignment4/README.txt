Used the same basic formula from before and adjusted for JS improvements that made it way easier.


I had JS in mind when I was originally creating this and actually had to work around the earlier assignments lack of allowing JS.

I am just trying to catch up so I didn't really try and check all of the requirements but just wanted to finish something presentable and shows I kinda know what I am doing. (just kinda tbh)
