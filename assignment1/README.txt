Plans for a trivia game

Have a form for user input to select out of a multiple choice question using form and radio inputs.

Form
  -Question
    -Answer 1
    -Answer 2
    -Answer 3
/Form


and use JS later to implement a check, such as maybe having each form have a radio that if it's "right" (correct ID) is green and triggers a blurb for facts, if wrong just red but shows the correct one and the blurb.
  -it would have to be waiting to check on a submit <button> that triggers a check.


Just some rough ideas. Don't know if this is what was wanted.
